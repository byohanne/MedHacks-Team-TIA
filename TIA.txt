Project Description:
TIA will provide users & their caregivers access to integrated custom rehabilitation planning, personalized care plans and curated resources to quickly recognize and prevent a stroke. Health tracking of potentially life threatening events like TIA or stroke using dynamic Q&A assessment.

TIA is a speech-to-text  app recognition designed to be a companion that understands users better than anyone around them.

It uses key words preceded by “Hey TIA” to begin the recording and transcribing process while not violating your privacy rights.

This portion of the project is what analyzes people's voices to begin the recognition process.

How to run TIA Tensorflow Neural Network:
In order to run the TIA Tensorflow Neural Network successfully the user should run the file titled “import tflearn” in their editor and have tflearn and Tensorflow installed. 

Software used in development:
*Python 
*Tensorflow
